    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lasagna recipe, while requiring some time and effort, delivers a delicious and customizable result.  It features a rich meat sauce made with Italian sausage, ground beef, onions, garlic, and a blend of tomato products enhanced with sugar and a variety of herbs and spices.</p> 
    <p>The lasagna is layered with noodles, a decadent mixture of parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheeses (bound with an egg), and then baked to perfection.</p>
